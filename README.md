#Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server

**Welcome to the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server project!**

**Note:** For the PHP 7 project, see the PHP7 branch

The Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server are PHP 5 extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The release contains two drivers, the SQLSRV driver and the PDO_SQLSRV driver. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PDO for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2005 and later (including SQL Azure). These drivers rely on the Microsoft ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.

We hope you enjoy using the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server.
